# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My shop site is a simple site that consists of 4 sections and one css file:
1- index.html
2- product.html
3- request.html
4- customer.html
5- project0.css

Detail:
1- index.html:
- It has a link to the other sections and from each one you can go back to index.html.
- In index I use container and row.

2- product.html:
- In Product I use a boostrap grid

3- customer.html:
In Customer I use a table with image

4- request.html:
- In Request I use an unordered list with links to references inside the html

5- project0.css:
In CSS file I use:
- hover for tag "a"
- styles for tag "table", "th" and "td"
- media for small screens
- styles for grid and grid-item class
- etc.
